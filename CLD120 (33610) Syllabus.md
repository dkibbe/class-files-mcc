## Grading Standards and Practices

### Letter Grades

Your grade is based on total points earned. Quizzes and labs are graded; Guided Exercises are not.

| Grade | Percent |
| ----- | ------- |
| A     | 90–100% |
| B     | 80–89%  |
| C     | 70–79%  |
| D     | 60–69%  |
| F     | 0–59%   |

### How Lab Assignments Are Graded

All work is completed in the AWS Canvas LMS. Scores do not sync to MCC Canvas automatically; I import them weekly.
Always check AWS Canvas for the most current lab and quiz scores.

---

## Late Assignments

This accelerated course requires consistent weekly study. Short, frequent study sessions are most effective.

Assignments have both a **Due Date** and an **Available Until** date. After the latter, submissions close.
Plan ahead.

**Important:**
If you miss **two consecutive lab assignments**, you may be dropped from the class.

---

## Course Final

The Course Assessment in AWS Canvas serves as the final exam.
You must earn **70% or higher** to receive the AWS badge of completion.

---

## Attendance Policy

This is a Hybrid class. You must attend weekly sessions either in person or via Zoom.
If attending via Zoom, a working webcam and microphone are required.
I recommend coming to campus at least once a week for lab assistance.

### Excused Absences

MCC allows excused absences for:

* College-sanctioned events
* Death in immediate family

## Artificial Intelligence Statement

AI will impact every career field. Used thoughtfully, it enhances learning by helping clarify concepts and suggest resources.

AI **cannot** replace human reasoning or the need to demonstrate your own understanding.
Misuse—including copying answers you do not understand—is academic dishonesty and may result in sanctions.

By remaining in this course, you agree to use generative AI in a manner that supports—rather than replaces—your learning and critical thinking.
